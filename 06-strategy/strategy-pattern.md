## About the Strategy Design Pattern

Defines a family of algorithms, each one encapsulated and made interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it. Instead of thinking of the duck behaviors as a set of behaviors, they can be considered family of algorithms. These behaviors can be reused in other context since they are no longer dependant on the Duck classes.
