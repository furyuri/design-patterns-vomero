# Design Patterns in OOP

Welcome to Computer Science Practice group. Today is the kickoff for a series of presentation on object oriented design patterns. We will be following the Oâ€™Reilly book [Head First Design Patterns](https://bookshop.org/books/head-first-design-patterns-building-extensible-and-maintainable-object-oriented-software/9781492078005) to level up our OOP skills and to challenge ourselves to build more maintainable software. We will also discuss when to use these patterns, when to avoid them, and look for places in our current project where these patterns are already in action.

Someone has already solved your problems. Design Patterns are a general purpose abstraction of a problem, which can be applied to a specific solution. As developers we tend to solve the same program over and over again; so, why reinvent the wheel?

They create a shared vocabulary (page 26).
